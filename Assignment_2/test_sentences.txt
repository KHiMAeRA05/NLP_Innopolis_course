The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Tomorrow will be a better day.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
He who hesitates is lost.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
The early bird catches the worm.
Time flies when you're having fun.
All good things must come to an end.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Actions speak louder than words.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Laughter is the best medicine.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Practice makes perfect.
Look before you leap.
Better late than never.
There's no time like the present.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Haste makes waste.
You reap what you sow.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Curiosity killed the cat.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
Beggars can't be choosers.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Money can't buy happiness.
The best things in life are free.
A watched pot never boils.
Blood is thicker than water.
Love conquers all.
What goes around, comes around.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Actions speak louder than words.
Beauty is only skin deep.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Crime doesn't pay.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Easy come, easy go.
Every dog has its day.
Fortune favors the bold.
Give credit where credit is due.
Good things come to those who wait.
Honesty is the best policy.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
Ignorance is bliss.
It takes two to tango.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Money talks.
No news is good news.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Patience is a virtue.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Slow and steady wins the race.
The early bird catches the worm.
There's no place like home.
Time is money.
To each his own.
Two heads are better than one.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
A leopard can't change its spots.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
All is fair in love and war.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Clothes make the man.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Every dog has its day.
Familiarity breeds contempt.
Fortune favors the brave.
Good things come to those who wait.
Haste makes waste.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
If you can't beat them, join them.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
